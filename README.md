# Visited Countries Catalog - React Learning Project

This is a project of a visited countries catalog that I developed as part of my journey in learning React. Throughout this journey, I've learned valuable lessons and acquired essential knowledge in React.

## About the Project

The goal of this project was to create a catalog of countries I've had the opportunity to visit and apply fundamental React concepts, especially the use of props for passing data between components. Here are the main features I implemented:

- **Reusable Components**: I created reusable components to display information about the countries, such as name, flag, and visit details.

- **Props**: I learned how to pass data from a parent component to a child component using props. This allowed for dynamic updates of the information displayed in each country card.

- **Local State**: I utilized local state to control the display of additional details about each country when the user clicked on a card.

- **Styling**: I applied CSS styles to make the catalog more attractive and responsive.

## Key Lessons Learned

During the creation of this project, some important lessons stood out:

- Props are essential: Understanding how to pass data between components using props is fundamental in React.

- Componentization is power: Dividing the user interface into smaller, reusable components makes the code more organized and easier to maintain.

- Practice makes perfect: Working on practical projects is the best way to learn. I made mistakes, adjusted my code, and learned a lot during the process.

## Next Steps

My learning journey in React is just beginning. Here are some of my upcoming goals:

- Deepen my knowledge of state management with Redux.

- Explore API integration to enrich details about the visited countries in real-time.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank everyone who supported me and shared their knowledge so far. I'm excited to continue learning and see what the future holds!
